# Store Application

Based on the proof of concept I did by creating a monolithic application [here](https://github.com/luisbirchenz/spring_store) in order 
to tests a couple of things about the business involved I decided to move it to microservices. 

Additionally, I'm going to use [Saga pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html)( The orchestration alternative) in order to
deal with distributed transaction.

This project is not completed so far, I'll be updating it as soon as I finish the services. It is going to be organized as multi maven module.
