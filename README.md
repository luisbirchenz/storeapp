# Store Application

Based on the proof of concept I did by creating a monolithic application [here](https://github.com/luisbirchenz/spring_store) in order 
to tests a couple of things about the business involved I decided to move that POC to microservices. 

Additionally, I'm going to use [Saga pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html)( The orchestration alternative) in order to
deal with distributed transaction.

This project is not completed so far, It is going to be organized as multi maven module. I pushed the first version in order to create an order, the happy path. There is not way to validate the order created, I'm working on that. I'll update this as soon as I finish the changes I'm dealing with. At the same time I'm going to explain what I did here as well. So stay tuned!
